# Skript-Snippets
A collection of useful snippets for skript

WARNING: this github collection was made primarily for 2.2dev36 (1.8) hence a lot of them have become redundant if you are using newer versions of skript. Skript-Snippets was made in order to make it easier for stubborn developers such as myself to work on outdated minecraft versions
